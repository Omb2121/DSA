This repository contains my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) practice solutions and coding exercises. It includes problems solved from LeetCode and other standard DSA examples that I practiced while strengthening my problem-solving skills.

The goal of this repository is to track my learning progress and build strong fundamentals in algorithms and data structures.

🚀 What This Repository Contains

✅ LeetCode solved problems

✅ Basic to advanced DSA concepts

✅ Example-based implementations

✅ Practice programs for interview preparation

✅ Clean and readable code solutions
